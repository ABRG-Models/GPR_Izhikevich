# GPR_Izhikevich

The Gurney-Prescott-Redgrave model coded up with Izhikevich model neurons

This model has been moved from the private ABRG-Models/abrg_local at
commit 439851a on 12th July 2016.

This is a collection of sample and sandbox Izhikevich models.

Particularly useful should be the reproductions of the various models
described in Izhikevich's 2003 paper "Simple Model of Spiking
Neurons".  IEE Transactions on Neural Networks, Vol 14 (See Fig. 2).

The original GPR model made up with candidate Izhikevich neurons is in
the bg1 subdirectory. Versions of the model with cortical integrator
inputs are in bg_withCI (3 channels) and bg_with_CI_5ch (etc).

Notes about the development of the individual neuron models and the
overall network are in labbook/ as ipython notebooks.
